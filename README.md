# Encryption-and-deception-assembly-project
 encryption and deception program using MIPS assembly 
 
# First :
 we make Encrypt and Decrypt using C programming language tjen convert it to assemply
 in our project: we will make encrypt and decrypt constant 32 bit integer number 
 in our code : we have 4 procedure (Encrypt - Decrypt - Print - main)
 
 #Second: for coding
 we use EMU8086 for code this programe we was do Encrypt and decrypt string but string should put in 32 bit 
 but this program have only 16bit registers so, we convert our task to encrypt and decrypt an 32bit divided to 
 (16 & 16) bitinteger number , but if anyone can use this programe in string should use built in library which called (Irvine32.inc).
