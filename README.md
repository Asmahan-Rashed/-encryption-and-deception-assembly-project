# Encryption-and-deception-assembly-project
 encryption and deception program using MIPS assembly 
 
# First :
 we make Encrypt and Decrypt using C programming language tjen convert it to assemply
 
 in our project: we will make encrypt and decrypt constant 32 bit integer number 
 
 in our code : we have 4 procedure (Encrypt - Decrypt - Print - main)
